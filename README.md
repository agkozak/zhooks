`zhooks` is a tool for displaying the code for all Zsh hook functions (such as `precmd`), as well as the contents of hook arrays (such as `precmd_functions`). It is useful in debugging conflicts between interactive scripts.

## Installation:

Simply source `zhooks` from your `.zshrc`:

    source /path/to/zhooks.plugin.zsh

or load it using your favorite Zsh plugin manager or framework. Then run the command `zhooks` from the command line to see a thorough report.

`zhooks` returns true when hooks are being used and false when they are not.
